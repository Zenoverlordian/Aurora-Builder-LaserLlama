            <p>Gods of darkness are often worshiped by cults and creatures that live deep underground. Almost entirely evil, their followers and cultists look to sow fear and confusion throughout the world by blotting out light and destroying the hope that comes with it. As a Cleric of shadow, why have you chosen to walk in their darkness?</p>

            <p>What motivates people more than anything? Gold. Clerics of Wealth recognize the great truth, that money makes the world go round. Merchants, bankers, aristocrats, and criminals all worship the gods of gold, and work to advance their god's agenda while also furthering their own interests.</p>
            <p class="indent">What motivated you to serve such a master? For what purposes to you manipulate, hoard, and expend your wealth?</p>
