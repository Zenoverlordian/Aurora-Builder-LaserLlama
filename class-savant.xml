        <description>
    <p>The slender elf cleaned her glasses with the corner of her cloak, as the dust began to settle around her. Her benefactor had paid her a handsome sum to locate this forgotten place, and after months of pouring over ancient tomes, she finally pieced together it's long-lost location. Now, she had a difficult choice to make. If she reported her findings to her benefactor, the temple would be stripped of its valuables. If she kept the location of her discovery hidden, then she could preserve the priceless knowledge contained within. For to a savant, knowledge is more precious then gold coins.</p>
    <p class="indent">The elderly human warrior assessed the state of the soldiers under his command. They were exhausted and almost out of supplies. It was the tenth day of the siege, and the old warrior knew in his heart that no reinforcements would be coming to save them. He was too old to be of much use in battle, but if his soldiers followed his orders to the letter, and without hesitation, they just might have a fighting chance. He stood up, and for what could be the last time, donned his shield and drew his sword from its scabbard.</p>
    <p class="indent">A young dwarf bent over his unconscious comrade in the midst of battle, his hands were shaking as he examined the unconscious soldier's wounds. The elders of his clan had spent a great deal of their fortune to send him to the best university gold could buy. All those hours spent in lectures, libraries, and observation, all for this moment. He thought back to all he had learned about field medicine and began to dress his comrade's wounds.</p>
    <h4>MAGNIFICENT MINDS</h4>
    <p>There are many intelligent people in the world, but few are true savants. Born with an innate desire to learn all they can, and the potential for a genius level intellect, savants spend their lives studying anything that those around them are willing to teach. Often recognized at an early age, their ravenous hunger for knowledge, draws them to great libraries, universities, and other places of higher learning. Willing to go to any lengths to access the hidden knowledge of the world, savants often turn to a life of adventuring. For a savant, no price is too steep to pay for a new discovery.</p>
    <p class="indent">Despite their aptitude for learning, most savants seek to better themselves without having to depend other forces. Rejecting the patronage of powerful beings, and considering wizardry a shortcut to power, savants rely on their intellect alone, as they strive for perfection.</p>
    <h4>INTENSELY FOCUSED</h4>
    <p>Savants hyper-focus on their area of academic study. They obsess and learn all they can about their area of expertise. This drive fuels every savant, and they are willing to put aside political, religious, or cultural divisions in order to learn. Once they have learned all academia can teach them, savants strike out into the world to advance their field of study .</p>
    <p class="indent">Often at great cost to themselves, a savant will not stop researching, experimenting, and theorizing until they have made an indelible mark on their academic discipline. Whether they realize it or not, the ultimate goal burning within the heart of every savant is to uncover some lost or previously unknown truth about the universe.</p>
    <h4>CREATING A SAVANT</h4>
    <p>When creating your savant, consider their upbringing and level of formal education. Were they the star pupil of the kingdom's university, or did they come from squal, fighting for any scrap of knowledge they could get their hands on? Consider why they became an adventurer rather than an academic. Have they advanced beyond study and look to the endless discoveries of a life of adventure?</p>
    <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>

            <p>You've come to understand the plants and animals of the natural world in a way that few people do. Starting at 13th level, you can use your action to touch a beast or plant and attempt to charm it as if casting the dominate beast spell. The save DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Unlike the spell, this feature can affect plants as well as beasts.</p>

            <p>Your mastery over the spoken word and your understanding of the multiverse allows you to exert your will to influence reality in minor ways. Starting at 3rd level, when you hit a creature that is the target of your Adroit Analysis with an attack, you can speak one of the words of power below, enhancing your attack. You can speak a word of power a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Saving Throws.</em></strong> The words of power you speak require the target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The save DC for your words of power is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Confound.</em></strong> You speak a word of power that sows confusion in the mind of your enemy. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target must subtract your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) from all attack rolls it makes before the end of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Debilitate.</em></strong> You speak a word of power that assaults your foe's senses. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is blinded, deafened, or is unable to speak (your choice) until the end of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Disorient.</em></strong> You speak a word of power that weakens the place of a creature in reality. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must subtract your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) from all saving throws it makes before the start of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Exhaust.</em></strong> You speak a word of power that drains the vitality of a foe. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target gains one level of exhaustion. If a creature has at least one level of exhaustion from this feature it can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

            <p>In every society there are those that look to deceive, swindle, and take advantage of common trust — thieves' guilds that run racketeering schemes, monsters that can shift their form to trick the innocent, and those who abuse their legitimate authority for personal gain. Standing in their way is the archetypal Seeker, those who use their considerable intellect to outwit any who obfuscate the truth.</p>

You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also on your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds of other creatures to determine their true intent. You excel at rooting out monsters that hide among, and prey upon ordinary folk, and your mastery of observation and your keen wit make you well equipped to expose, and defeat, hidden evils.</p>
